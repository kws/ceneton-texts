If any Christian hero has excelled through an illustrious act, it is the minister <font size = -1>ANTHONIUS HAMBROEK</font>; an act of which, apart from the well-known case of <font size = -1>REGULUS</font>, there may be no other example to be found in any history. In the treatment of my subject I have mainly conformed myself to what <font size = -1>SCHOUTEN</font> tells us about it in his East Indian voyages. I shall put down here what happened to the honest <font size = -1>HAMBROEK</font> in some detail; making certain that the surprises in my play will not be spoiled by it. It was in the previous century that the Chinese pirate <font size = -1>COXINGA</font>, took by surprise the flourishing island of Formosa, which is situated off the coast of the Chinese empire. He landed so unexpectedly, that he captured the minister <font size = -1>HAMBROEK</font>, his wife, son and daughter, as well as many other eminent Christians, because these unfortunate ones did not manage to save themselves within the main stronghold Zeelandia. The Dutch attacked the quickly-erected strongholds of the assaulter; but had to rush headlong back into the stronghold Zeelandia, almost in the same way as I have represented it in my play, after the brave commander <font size = -1>PETEL</font>, [<a href="Facsimiles/NomszHambroek1775/source/NomszHambroek1775a04.html" target = "new">fol. *2v</a>] who had gone out too far, had been killed with most of his men. The death of this hero&#146;s son happened in almost the same way as I have <font size = -1>FREDRIK</font> describe it in act two. The Chinese general <font size = -1>COXINGA</font>, annoyed at the unexpected opposition, decided to take another road than that of weapons, to capture Zeelandia. He sent the grey-haired <font size = -1>HAMBROEK</font> to the commander in chief of the Dutch, <font size = -1>FREDRIK CAJET</font>, with orders to claim the fortress, under the threat of killing <font size = -1>HAMBROEK</font>, if the commander continued to defend himself. To which he added that he would have the wife and children of that minister hacked to pieces, if <font size = -1>HAMBROEK</font> did not return to the Chinese army within the time he set him. This message put the brave <font size = -1>CAJET</font> in a very difficult position: <font size = -1>HAMBROEK</font> was his best friend, and two children of that minister were inside Zeelandia. Friendship spoke in the heart of the commander, and <font size = -1>HAMBROEK</font>&#146;s children did not fail to urge him to surrender the fortress, through begging and groaning. <font size = -1>CAJET</font> was not disinclined to do so; but, since he had supplies of everything to last a long time, he found himself troubled because he would have to account for himself before the council of Java, from whom he could expect support and relief. According to some reports he nevertheless proposed the surrender to his friend <font size = -1>HAMBROEK</font>, as the only means of saving him; [<a href="Facsimiles/NomszHambroek1775/source/NomszHambroek1775a05.html" target = "new">fol. *3r</a>] but this magnanimous man rejected that proposal with extreme indignation, and encouraged <font size = -1>CAJET</font> and the garrison to a stubborn resistance. And neither the proposal by <font size = -1>CAJET</font> and the other commanders, nor the tears of his children saved in the fortress Zeelandia, could move the noble hero to keep his life at the loss of the fortress. He finally departed for the enemy&#146;s army, after having said a sorrowful goodbye to his friends, and after he had seen his two unhappy children succumb at his feet from sadness and despair. As soon as he had returned to the enemy&#146;s army, he was decapitated before the eyes of his wife and children; covering his executioners with eternal shame. Everything concerning this infamous act, and other occurrences of the famous Formosan siege, may be read at more length in Schouten, Valentyn and others.<br>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; I have allowed myself some poetic licence in the treatment of this touching subject; but I have also striven always to stay as close to the history as was possible to me. Should the behaviour of the noble Christian minister make but one enemy of Christianity successfully see how far true Christianity can bring man, and from what noble principles the true Christian performs great deeds; should my Play persuade people in general that the triumph [<a href="Facsimiles/NomszHambroek1775/source/NomszHambroek1775a06.html" target = "new">fol. *3v</a>] of our reasonable and loveable Religion truly consists of encouraging and consoling people in the most oppressing disasters of life: I would consider myself richly rewarded for my labour.<br>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; I know by now that, in our days, I would have more readers and admirers for my play, if I had used my work to make the Christians&#146; minister ridiculous, and to make the Christian revelation seem, if not despicable, at least implausible to sensible people; but what readers and what admirers! Undoubtedly it becomes no one to seek the approval and acclaim of people who put their pride in making everything despicable that most deserves the respect of mortals, and make themselves the object of justified ridicule and loathing. No worldly acclaim can outweigh the noble pleasure that a good intention, and a good deed done for the common good, affords the soul. The grand duke of Luxembourg affirmed on his deathbed that the memory of having offered a mug of cold water to an unfortunate to revive him, gratified him more than the memory of all his victories. See there an example worthy of being constantly present in our mind in the hours of prosperity! What do glory, great deeds, ingenious inventions, reason and external proprieties avail us, if the source of our actions is not noble, the heart not pure, and our conscience not satisfied with us!<br>[<a href="Facsimiles/NomszHambroek1775/source/NomszHambroek1775a07.html" target = "new">fol. *4r</a>]<br>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Furthermore I owe some thanks to several distinguished people, who have encouraged me in the treatment of this virtuous and moving subject. And the unusual eagerness with which my other plays, (both those that have been shown in the Theatres of our country, and those that have never been performed on a Stage), have been received, and still are received, has been no small encouragement to me to further expend my slight skills, in spite of all envy, for the benefit of my fellow men.<br>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; I finish with the words of that great master of the Dramatic Art, the incomparable RACINE: &#146;It would be desirable if our Plays were as succinct, sensible, moral and improving as those of most of the poets of antiquity. If our Plays were as full of instructive teachings; we could possibly remove the aversion which several honourable Theologians and other people worthy of every respect because of their piety, harbour against the Stage, and reconcile them with the Theatre and Dramatic Poetry. At least we would make them judge these things more favourably, if the Playwrights of our time would apply themselves more to teaching and improving the readers and spectators of their plays than to amusing them; and therefore would comply more with the true objective of Dramatic Poetry.&#146;</td></tr></table><br><a name = "personages">[<a href="Facsimiles/NomszHambroek1775/source/NomszHambroek1775a08.html" target = "new">fol. *4v</a>]<br><hr><br><table border = 0 cellpadding = 12><tr><td width = 333 align = center><h4>DRAMATIS PERSONAE.</h4></td></tr></table><table border = 0><tr><td>ANTHONIUS HAMBROEK,</td><td><i>minister on Formosa.</i><td></tr><tr><td>FREDRIK CAJ&#201;T,</td><td><i>commander in chief in the stronghold Zeelandia.</i><td></tr><tr><td>FREDRIK CAJET DE JONGE,</td><td><i>his son.</i><td></tr><tr><td>CORNELIA HAMBROEK,</td><td><i>daughter of the minister; wife to Fredrik.</i><td></tr><tr><td>XAMTI,</td><td><i>emissary of the Chinese general Coxinga.</i><td></tr><tr><td>VAN DEN BROEK,</td><td><i>a captain, friend to Fredrik.</i><td></tr><tr><td>ELIZABETH,</td><td><i>friend to Cornelia.</i><td></tr></table><br>The SCENE is inside the castle ZEELANDIA, on the island of FORMOSA.<br><br><table border = 0 cellpadding = 12><tr><td width = 450 align = center><h4><a name = "Eerste"><a href = "#Tweede"><br><img align=bottom alt="Continue" border = 0 src="https://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/Dutch/Stijl/Goudstaf.gif"></a></h4></td></tr></table>[<a href="Facsimiles/NomszHambroek1775/source/NomszHambroek1775p01.html" target = "new">p. 1</a>]<br><table border = 0 cellpadding = 12><tr><td width = 450 align = center><h4><font size = +3>ANTHONIUS HAMBROEK,</font><br><br>OR<br><br><font size = +1>THE SIEGE</font><br><br>OF<br><br><font size = +3>FORMOSA,</font><br><br><i>TRAGEDY.</i><br><br><hr><br><font size = +1>ACT ONE.</font><br><br>SCENE ONE.<br><br><font size = -1>CORNELIA</font>, <font size = -1>ELIZABETH</font>.</h4></td></tr></table><table border = 0 cellpadding = 6><tr><td align = center width = 333><font size = -1>CORNELIA</font>, <i>with a despondent demeanour, sitting in an armchair.</i></td></tr></table><font size = +3>F</font>riend, desist: your comfort can only be useless;<br>In vain one consoles a heart that has everything to fear.<br><table border = 0 cellpadding = 6><tr><td align = center width = 333><font size = -1>ELIZABETH</font>.</td></tr></table>Maybe you fear too much.<br><table border = 0 cellpadding = 6><tr><td align = center width = 333><font size = -1>CORNELIA</font>, <i>rising.</i></td></tr></table>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Too much?
