# Ceneton Transcript Archive

This repository contains an archival copy of the Ceneton transcripts: a comprehensive census of Dutch-language theatrical works up to the year 1803. Developed and maintained by the Department of Dutch at Leiden University, Ceneton ("Census Nederlands Toneel") is a major scholarly resource documenting over 12,500 plays, including metadata, bibliographic details, and textual editions. The original datasource is available at https://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/Dutch/Ceneton/.

The purpose of this repository is to add unique and immutable IDs and version control to the transcripts to make them easier to reference.

Some typos and broken links on the original website are corrected. These are tracked in the [extras](./extras) folder.

This URL list is built from the [ceneton-database](https://github.com/kws/ceneton-database) repository.

The code and utilities for maintining the archive are in the [ceneton-texts-utils](https://github.com/kws/ceneton-texts-utils) repository.
